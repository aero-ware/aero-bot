# aero-bot
This repo is a template that contains basic functions that almost any bot should have.
 
## How to run the bot
Running this bot is not that complicated. Here are instructions on how to do so:

### Inviting the bot to your server
You can invite the bot [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=787460489427812363&permissions=8&scope=bot) or use this code to run it yourself. To run it yourself check [Running the bot Yourself](###Running-the-Bot-Yourself)

### Running the Bot Yourself
0. Install node.js and npm if they are not already installed. [node.js installer](https://nodejs.org/en/)
1. Clone this repo using `git clone https://github.com/dheerajpv/discord-bot.git`, then `cd` into the repo folder.
    - Alternatively, you can use this repo as a template to make your own repo and then clone it
2. Install all the dependencies using `npm i`
3. Create a new file in the directory called `.env` and add the following:
    - The `token` is a string generated by Discord that acts as authentication for the bot. [More info on generating tokens](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot)
    - The `snowflakeToken` is the access token for the [Snowflake API](https://api.snowflakedev.xyz)
    - The `mongoPath` is a URI that the bot will use to connect to the mongoDB database.
    - The `defaultPrefix` is the ~~default prefix in any server before it is reassingned~~ [what else would it be](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)?
    - the `adminIds` should be a comma separated list of user IDs, ex: `id1,id2,id3` who can use the `ownerOnly` commands
    - Here is an example of a valid `.env` file:

```
token=<your discord bot token goes here>
snowflakeToken=<your snowflake API token goes here>
mongoPath=<uri to your mongoDB server (local or remote)>
defaultPrefix=<a char/string that will be the default prefix for the bot>
adminIds=<a comma separated list of user IDs that should be the bot owner(s)>
```
4. Run `node .` to run the bot!
5. Generate yourself an invite link using the OAuth2 tab of the application page, check scope `bot` and be sure to give it the `Administrator` permission.

## Library Documentation
This bot uses the [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/general/welcome) and its optional libraries to take advantage of its easy access to the Discord API without having to directly and manually send HTTP requests to Discord.

It also uses the [WOKCommands command handler](https://github.com/AlexzanderFlores/WOKCommands) to use its pre-made advanced command handler that has many advantages to making one manually.

The [mongoose](https://npmjs.com/package/mongoose) library is used to access the mongoDB database.

The [axios](https://npmjs.com/package/axios) package is used to perform API requests.

The [date-fns](https://npmjs.com/package/date-fns) package is used to format dates and durations.

Finally, the [ms](https://npmjs.com/package/ms) package is used in certain commands to convert strings such as `1d6h` into milliseconds.

## Bot Documentation
Information for all the commands of the bot can be seen by running `>help` and navigating the resulting menus. A web version of this is currently in development [here](https://dheerajpv.github.io/aero-bot/commands.html). If anyone wants to help by adding command information, don't hesitate to check [Development](#Development) for more info (The website is in the docs folder).
